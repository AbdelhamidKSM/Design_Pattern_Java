About Design Pattern &amp; SOLID Principal
## Desing Pattern :
* Singelton: when the class generates one object 
* Observer: Observer is a behavioral design pattern. It specifies communication between objects: observable and observers. An observable is an object which             notifies observers about the changes in its state.
* Factory: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
* Decorator: Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
* Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
* Proxy: Controls access to another object. 
* Command: Encapsulates a request as an object.
* Template: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
* State: Changes an object's behavior when its state changes.


## Solid Principles
* Single Responsablity: A class should have only one job.
* Open Closed Classes: should be extendable without modifying them.
* Liskov Substitution: Subclasses should be replaceable for their base classes.
* Interface Sugregation: No client should be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use.
* Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
